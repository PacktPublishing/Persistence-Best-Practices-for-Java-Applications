**Effective strategies for distributed cloud-native applications and data-driven modernization**

## What is this book about?
Having a solid software architecture breathes life into tech solutions. In the early stages of an application’s development, critical decisions need to be made, such as whether to go for microservices, a monolithic architecture, the event-driven approach, or containerization. In Java contexts, frameworks and runtimes also need to be defi ned. But one aspect is often overlooked – the persistence layer – which plays a vital role similar to that of data stores in modern cloud-native solutions. To optimize applications and data stores, a holistic understanding of best practices, technologies, and existing approaches is crucial.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Gain insights into data integration in Java services and the inner workings of frameworks
* Apply data design patterns to create a more readable and maintainable design system
* Understand the impact of design patterns on program performance
* Explore the role of cloud-native technologies in modern application persistence
* Optimize database schema designs and leverage indexing strategies for improved performance
* Implement proven strategies to handle data storage, retrieval, and management efficiently
